=====

The 3D printing process is becoming very popular recently and used in many different fields. 3D printing, also called additive manufacturing, is a process of creating 3D dimensional physical objects from a digital file. There are different 3D printing technologies and materials you can go with in the industry now. However, mostly uses same principle, a digital file is turned into a solid physical three-dimensional object by adding material layer by layer.
