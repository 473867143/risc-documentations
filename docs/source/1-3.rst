Quadcopter Assembly
=====

This is a tutorial for RISC lab boot camp. Please find all the components in RISC shoebox and toolbox prepared in Area C’s shelf.

Basic principles
-----

Feel free to place the components anywhere but take care of wirings. Refer to quads we already have in the lab. Carefully choose zipties, shrinking tubes, duct tapes or soldering for different situations. Generally, for fixing motor wires we use **zipties**. Shrinking tubes are for permanent connection between wires while soldering then together. Pay attention to **calibration**, and prepare for 50% possibility of fail :-)

Hardware assembly

Introduction
^^^^^

You will need

* Quadcopter frame. 250 frame will be a good start. 250 means the motor to motor diameter, as shown below.

* Power distribution board to distribute power from a battery to 4 ESCs.

* Flight Controller.

Use any flight controller available in the lab. Just make sure you have compatible power modules, receivers, GPS, and other additional modules. The documentations for each board are avaiblea at `here <https://docs.px4.io/en/flight_controller/pixhawk_series.html>`_.

* Motors and propellers, while installing mind their directions (CW vs CCW).


* Electronic speed controller (ESC) controls and regualates the speed of an electric brushless motor. All ESCs comes with a rating. The Turnigy Multistar ESC shown below has a rating of 10A, meaning it can draw a maximum continuous current of 10A. Anything higher than 10A will eventually burn or damage the ESC.

.. note:: 

  Drawing 10A for a long time (~10mins) will heat up the ESC and damage it as well. Always use a higher rating ESC for your setup. E.g. If your motor draws 10A (at full throttle), use either a 12A or a 15A. If the 12A and the 15A ESC weight approximately the same, choose the 15A. A higher rating ESC will prevent overheating. To handle more power, a high rating ESC will be required. As the rating goes up, the weight, size and cost of the ESC go up as well. Always consider how much power you will need by looking up your motor specification (Max current motor drawn). 


* RC receiver to control quadcopter. FrSky or Spektrum.

* UBEC (Universal Battery eliminator circuit) to convert voltage to power Odroid (in case you are using it). A BEC is basically a step down voltage regulator. It will take your main battery voltage (e.g. 11.1 Volts) and reduce it down to ~5 Volts to safely power your Odroid and other electronics.

* Power module. It is the best way to provide power for flight controller unit. It has voltage and current sensors that allows autopilot to estimate remaining battery charge precisely. Usually it comes with every autopilot controleer as default kit. Check official documentations to match right power module to a selected flight controller.

* LiPo battery. Assuming you know what is the balancer, cell count and voltage, capacity and C-rating.

Assembly process
^^^^^

* Assemble the frame. Attach the power distribution board to it.

* Mount the motors to the frame. Mind CW and CCW directions. They should be mounted as follows. We usually use **X** configuration.

.. important::

	Do not install propellers now.


.. note:: 

  **Front** direction of the quadcopter needs to be decided. Take a look at your flight controller and there’s an arrow that should be pointed to **front** when mounted. Also it should point between motor 1 and 3 in above picture.

* Connect ESCs to motors and plug ESCs to power distribution board. As for now, connect motors to ESCs arbitrary, later you will set them properly by switching any two wires.


* Install power module. Find a place to fix it. One end should be plugged to power distribution board and the other end to battery. DON’T plug it for now.

* Install Pixhawk above the power distribution board but separate from it.

* There is a wire for powering Pixhawk in the powerwires. Plug it to the power port of the Pixhawk.

* Install buzzer and switch to Pixhawk using their own ports.

* Connect each of your PWM ESCs to the corresponding **Main Out** output.

* Mind the direction of jumper wires

* The numbers on those pins on Pixhawk correspond to the motor numbers of motors in the picture.

* Bind the RC receiver with an RC (Use Spectrum RC because those receivers in the shoebox should be used with them) and install them. We have one special binder to do that and it’s placed in the toolbox beside RISC shoeboxes. You will also find RCs there. The binding process is as follows:

  + Insert the jumper wire to Pixhawk like a motor, we just need to power it through this way
  + Insert the signal wire to another end of the RC receiver
  + Plug the battery (Find in the toolbox) to power wire
  + Turn on the RC while pressing the left up button (marked as Trainer Bind), wait until the RC receiver is lighting statically
  + Remove the RC from binder, use its own signal wire to connect with Pixhawk via port SPKT/DSM

* Plug the battery and check 4 ESCs has static green LED lighted up and BEC has red. Buzzer will produce sound in the beginning and remain silent. Unplug the battery.

* For this stage there’s no need to install Odroid. This will be illustrated later.

Calibration process
-----

* Download ``QGroundControl`` on your PC and open it.

* Connect Pixhawk with your PC via USB. You should see it connected in the software.

* In ``Airframe tab`` choose proper airframe according to the one you have.

* In ``Radio tab`` click ``Calibrate`` button and follow instructions.

* In ``Sensors tab`` calibrate all the sensors following the instructions. After calibration they will be green. Note that there will be a progress bar while calibrationg each sensor, which indicates your progress. After finishing calibration of one sensor, wait until it reaches the end and then press ``OK`` and move on to the next.

* In ``Flight Modes tab``

  - Modes: Channel 6 (marked as ``FLAP/GYRO``)
  - Mode 1: Position
  - Mode 4: Altitude
  - Mode 6: Manual
  - Kill switch: Channel 5 (GEAR MIX)
  - If you set them right, when you are picking those channels your action will be reported in ``QGroundControl``

* In ``Power tab`` write the parameters of your battery (Number of cells, Full/ Empty voltages)

  - Click ``Calculate`` beside ``Voltage divider`` and type in measured voltage (can be measured using multimeter in the toolbox), click ``Calculate``
  - Click ``Calibrate`` to calibrate ESCs

* In ``Parameters tab`` tune the parameters, general process is tuning ``P`` first then ``I`` and ``D`` at last for yaw, pitch and roll. Hold the quad in your hand to feel if it’s well tuned. You may follow this `guide <https://docs.px4.io/en/advanced_config/pid_tuning_guide_multicopter.html>`_.

* You can plug other quads we have to your PC and export the parameters there and load them to your quad directly


Flying
------

* Unplug the quadcopter from PC
* Press Safety switch on Pixhawk until it blinks faster
* Arm (Hold throttle at minimum and rudder to the right for 2 seconds) the quad using RC and check if the motors are spinning in correct directions as the picture by slightly touching them. If not, change any two wires of that motor. Disarm (Opposite of arm)
* Install propellers. Note that there are CW and CCW propellers as well.
* **OPTIONAL.** If still want to connect the quad to ``QGroundControl``, install telemetry
* Manual kill switch off. Select manual mode.
* Check battery condition. **Always keep this in mind.**
* Put the quad in the cage and arm again. Slowly add throttle while keep it in the middle of the cage by controlling pitch and yaw.
* If it flies, you can do more manoeuvres

Troubleshooting
------

* Motors not rotating while armed and rotates with higher throttle

  - Check PWM min/max in parameters and make sure it’s associated with ESCs
